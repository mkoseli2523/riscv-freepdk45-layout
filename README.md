# RISC-V Processor Physical Design & Layout

This project implements a 32-bit multicycle RISC-V processor using the FreePDK 45nm process. It combines full-custom layout for the datapath and place-and-route automation for the control unit.

The full-custom datapath layout is included in the `datapath/` folder, and the placed-and-routed top-level processor is included in the `PNR/` folder.
